[Details](https://github.com/DatTrongNg/cGAN_Segmentation/tree/main)

##### Stacks:
- Python
- Pytorch
- CNN, cGAN, Unet

#### Apply auto-endcoder on distance estimation in drone navigation:
Integrate a distance estimation auto-encoder model into a drone control system, allowing for the estimation of the drone's location based on the depth information derived from its camera feed; therefore, having suitable coressponding action.
